## Data visualization samples
In this project, I am reproducing figures in *Visualizing Data*, a book written  by William Cleveland. 
- The `cleveland_vizdata.Rmd` contains R code that generates the figures.
- The `cleveland_vizdata.md` is the rendered file in github document format showing the figures.
